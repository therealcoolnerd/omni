# Git Hooks

This repository does not require any Git hooks by default. All files that were originally shipped in `.git/hooks` were stock examples generated by Git. They have been moved to [`docs/git-hook-samples/`](git-hook-samples/) for reference.

Developers are free to install their own hooks if desired. Common examples include running `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before commits or verifying commit messages. You can use the sample scripts as a starting point if you wish.
