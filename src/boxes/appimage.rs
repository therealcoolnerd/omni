//! Conceptual support for AppImage packages.

//! The functions in this module are placeholders and do not perform actual
//! AppImage installations or uninstallation. They outline the steps that
//! would be involved in a full implementation.

/// Conceptually "installs" an AppImage.
///
/// This function currently only prints a message indicating what steps would be
/// taken in a full implementation (download, make executable, integrate).
/// It does not perform any actual file operations.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `package_source` - The source of the AppImage, typically a URL or a local file path.
///                      In the context of Omni's manifest, this often comes from the `source` field.
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` always, as this is a conceptual placeholder.

    // 1. Download from package_source if it's a URL.
    // 2. Determine a suitable installation directory (e.g., ~/Applications or ~/.local/bin).
    // 3. Make the AppImage file executable (chmod +x).
    // 4. Optionally, integrate with the system (e.g., create a .desktop file, register with appimagelauncher).
    // 5. Consider how to handle updates and naming conventions for multiple versions.

/// # Arguments
/// * `package_name` - The identifier for the AppImage to be uninstalled. This would typically
///                    correspond to the name or path stored during installation (e.g., in history).
