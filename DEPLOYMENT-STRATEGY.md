## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
```yaml
performance:
  startup_time: <500ms (p95)
  search_time: <2000ms (p95)
  install_time: <30s typical package (p95)
  memory_usage: <50MB baseline
  
reliability:
  uptime: >99.9%
  error_rate: <0.5%
  crash_rate: <0.1%
  
user_experience:
  first_run_success: >95%
  command_success_rate: >99%
  user_satisfaction: >90%
```

### Monitoring Stack
- **Metrics:** Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging:** Structured logging to stdout/files
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry or similar
- **Performance:** Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- **User Analytics:** Telemetry (opt-in only)

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
critical_alerts:
  - crash_rate > 1% (immediate)
  - error_rate > 5% (immediate)
  - response_time > 10s (5 minutes)
  
warning_alerts:

- **Rollback Process:**
  1. Stop new deployments
  2. Route traffic to previous version
  3. Send alerts to on-call team
  4. Create incident report
  5. Post-mortem analysis

### Manual Rollback
- **Emergency Procedure:** <15 minutes to previous stable version
- **Communication:** Status page updates, user notifications
- **Recovery:** Root cause analysis, fix development, re-deployment

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Security Testing
- **SAST:** Static Application Security Testing in CI
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automated vulnerability checking
- **Container Scanning:** Image security analysis
- **Penetration Testing:** Annual third-party security audit
