# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue in Omni, please use the GitHub [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/therealcoolnerd/omni/security/advisories/new) feature. This allows the maintainers to address the problem before it becomes public.

Avoid filing public issues for security problems. If you prefer email, contact the project maintainer via `arealcoolcompany@gmail.com`.

Thank you for helping keep Omni safe for everyone.
