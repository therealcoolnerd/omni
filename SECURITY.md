# ⚫ Security Policy — We Take This Seriously

**Package managers are high-trust software.** When you install packages, you're basically giving us root access to your system. We don't take that responsibility lightly.

## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

### **Private Disclosure (Preferred)**
Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/therealcoolnerd/omni/security/advisories/new) feature. This keeps things secure while we fix the issue.

### **Email Reporting**  
Send details to: **arealcoolcompany@gmail.com**
- Include proof of concept if possible
- Describe the impact and scope
- We respond within 48 hours

### **What NOT To Do**
- ❌ Don't open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Don't post exploits on social media  
- ❌ Don't spam multiple channels

## ⚡ Our Commitment

**Response Timeline:**
- **48 hours**: Initial response acknowledging the report
- **7 days**: Preliminary assessment and triage
- **30 days**: Patch development and testing
- **90 days**: Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

**We Will:**
- Credit you in release notes (if you want)
- Keep you updated on fix progress
- Work with you on responsible disclosure

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

**We implement:**
- GPG signature verification for packages
- Checksum validation for all downloads
- Privilege escalation only when necessary  
- SQLite database encryption for sensitive data
- Secure communication over HTTPS/TLS

**We audit:**
- All external dependencies regularly
- Code for common vulnerability patterns
- Package manager integrations for security gaps
